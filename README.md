# News
## Concept:
#### Getting top News <100 points from https://news.ycombinator.com and displaying them in a website hosted as sub page of [my web app](https://deepaksai.pythonanywhere.com) .
#### How? : pythonanywhere allow  us to run a script on cloud at certain time once a day. 
#### So we run a webscrapper to scrape the news from https://news.ycombinator.com daily once day and display them in our web with respective links. We currently just deals everything in csv file. No databases( we dont know them yet).
#### So, we design a web scrapping bot, a html page linking to csv file that gonna constantly update top news with links everyday.
#### Tools that gonna be used:
Python flask, Jinga, HTML, CSS, JS
